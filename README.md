# Drupal Custom Contact Form Block

I needed a contact form with some custom fields. And I needed it as a module to easily put it on any site I want without too much clicks. Here it is.

1. download, unzip, customize form code, add recipients
2. enable, place block, test
3. be happy

TO DO
some translation functionality (.pot?)
